\section{Team Organisation and Collaboration}
\subsection{Team Name}
The team agreed unanimously to \textbf{SwanTech} as our team / company name.

We will use Java package name \textbf{com.swantech} in all Java classes.


\subsection{Team Organisation}
The M24 module 2015 has only 4 people attending, but 5 roles are identified in the lecture notes, so we have to split one role. The roles assigned are:\\

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l| }   % BE CAREFUL this is <pipe><lower case l><pipe><lower case l ><pipe> , not 'lllll' as it looks but rather |l|l| !!!
 \hline
 Customer Interface Manager & Simon Hewitt  \\ 
 Design Manager & David Tacey  \\ 
 Implementation Manager & Ifetayo Agunbiade  \\ 
 Test Manager & Mohamad Khaleqi \\
 Planning and Quality Manager  (PQM)& \textit{split between team members:}\\
 PQM - Team management & David Tacey\\
 PQM - Version Control and Code Inspections & Simon Hewitt\\
 PQM - Documentation & Ifetayo Agunbiade\\
 PQM - Coded Quality & Mohamad Khaleqi \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}\\

The team will meet formally each Monday at 15:00, in the Computer Science lab at Faraday 206, and will meet informally to check progress after the Wednesday lectures.
\\
Ifetayo is investigating team time management tools that support work breakdown and delivery timelines (WBS and Gantt chart capabilities are needed). This will be an online tool allowing all team members to share and update progress.

\subsection {Team Collaboration}
The team will collaborate informally through a Facebook group, which has now been set up. Formal documents that are part of the development and delivery will be maintained in GitHub, chosen for its strong team collaboration  capabilities, version control and multi-platform support.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\subsection{Team Role : Customer Interface Manager}

Simon Hewitt will be the Customer Interface Manager, as defined in the lecture slides "Team Roles and Group Work"
From the lecture notes, 
the Customer Interface Manager is responsible for:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The team's relationship with it's customers
  \item Resolving ambiguities in requirements specifications
\end{enumerate}

To do this I propose the following actions and deliverables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Schedule regular meetings with the customers:- Ben Mora and Bob Laramee, to be agreed with them
\item Create populate and manage a user requirements document
\item Ensure non-functional requirements meet customer expectations
\item Create and manage the assumptions and issues list in the project control structure
\item Ensure the team has understanding of the requirements through formal requirements specification reviews
\item And ensure team understands requirements by informal discussions at team meetings
\item Review the designs to ensure they meet the requirements
\item Review the test plans and test cases to ensure user requirements are tested and validated
\item Responsible for managing each stage sign-off, ensuring the team deliverables meet the requirements and the customer accepts these deliverables as fit for purpose
\end{itemize}
As we will be following a RAD approach rather than a traditional waterfall, the requirements document will not be signed off and frozen, but will be the guide for each RAD development cycle. The requirements specification will be updated as necessary from feedback from RAD delivery and review. We believe that allowing the customer to see, use and feedback on developing work ensures that we are on track to deliver what is really needed rather that what was written down (with the possible ambiguities that can arise from the complex process of documenting requirements). Furthermore, this RAD approach enables the development team to propose improvements and design alternatives that may deliver a better product.
\\
\\
We will investigate  requirement documentation alternatives over the next 14 days. This can range from an Excel spreadsheet to high cost , high complexity commercial offerings designed for huge teams and multi year projects. We will be looking for small scale, preferably open source solutions. 

\subsection{Team Role : Design Manager}

\subsection{Team Role : Implementation Manager}

\newpage
\subsection{Team Role : Test Manager}
Test manager role will be \textit{Mohamad Khaleqi} resposibility. The test manager roles is a task with responsibility for the test effort's\footnote{Testing is the process of evaluating a system and the components to check if they are working correctly or not. Basically, it means to check the system to find errors, gaps, bugs and missing requirement or on the other words testing is a process of analysing a software to detect the difference between existing and required conditions.
} success. This role involves codes quality and codes testing. For test manager there are some roles:
\begin{itemize}
 \item understanding the testing by analyzing the project requirements.
 \item Organize the testing meeting.
 \item Develope the test plan.
 \item Arrange the software and hardware requirement for the test.
 \item Document all testing result and prepare a report.
 \item Communicate with team's members.
\end{itemize}
In order to do these, I should:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Prepare Unit testing e.g. JUnit\footnote{Testing will not catch every error in the program, because it cannot evaluate every execution path in any but the most trivial programs. The same is true for unit testing. Additionally, unit testing by definition only tests the functionality of the units themselves. Therefore, it will not catch integration errors or broader system-level errors (such as functions performed across multiple units, or non-functional test areas such as performance). Unit testing should be done in conjunction with other software testing activities, as they can only show the presence or absence of particular errors; they cannot prove a complete absence of errors. In order to guarantee correct behavior for every execution path and every possible input, and ensure the absence of errors, other techniques are required, namely the application of formal methods to proving that a software component has no unexpected behavior.
}
 \item Integration testing\footnote{In some books it is called as Component testing.}There are two types of testing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Button-up integration testing. \\
begin with Unit testing and then moving to higher level combinations of units called modules or builds.
\item Top-Down integration testing.\\
In this test, first higher level modules are tested and then low level module. 
\end{itemize}
In developing software process, usually Button-up integration test happens first and then Top-Down integration test.~\cite{sommerville2009software}

 \item Software testing (Testing and debugging)
 \item Black Box and white Box
 \item Alpha and Beta testing
 \item Regression testing
 \item Ensure the team has understanding of the testing methods and also terms in testing unit. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
Software testing is a combinatorial problem. For example, every boolean decision statement requires at least two tests: one with an outcome of "true" and one with an outcome of "false". As a result, for every line of code written, programmers often need 3 to 5 lines of test code.\cite{myers2011art} This obviously takes time and its investment may not be worth the effort. There are also many problems that cannot easily be tested at all – for example those that are nondeterministic or involve multiple threads. In addition, code for a unit test is likely to be at least as buggy as the code it is testing. 
\end{comment}

\subsection{Team Role : Planning and Quality Manager}

\subsubsection{PQM - Team Management}
\subsubsection{PQM - Version Control and Code Inspection}
This part role will be handled by Simon Hewitt. Version Control is managed by GitHub, so I will ensure the team understand GitHub and how to use it, that they properly use check-out and check-in. I will have control over final deliverable versions, and managing branch merging.
Code inspection will be peer review across the group. I will investigate mark up tools. The MicroSoft Word document review tools are a powerful tool for team review, I will seek something similar for plain-text code files. 
\subsubsection{PQM - Documentation}
\subsubsection{PQM - Code Quality}
This part will be Mohamad Khaleqi resposibility. In order to check the code quality in Java, First I will use Eclipse IDE because of autamatic code indentation and auto formating. Then I will make sure the code is following Bob's Concise Coding Conventions and also Doxygen. In addition to have better and tidy code, I will use CodePro Analytix \footnote{CodePro Analytix is the premier Java software testing tool for Eclipse developers who are concerned about improving software quality and reducing developments costs and schedules. More info: \url{https://developers.google.com/java-dev-tools/codepro/doc/}} and PMD\footnote{ PMD is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth.More info: \url{http://pmd.sourceforge.net/}} which they are both Eclipse plugin. They are both perfectly fine with any problem in the code and both are compatible with Java code. For code quality I will use LTFCE definition. The code over its lifetime will be read many more times than written. So, good code is: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{L}egible: Only the code(Not comment) should clearly state the indent and reader should easily make sense of the code.
 \item \textbf{T}estable: The could will be in the way that unit tester can do its job.
 \item \textbf{F}elxible: Dependencies, both on other code in the code base and arbitrary implementation choices, should be minimized.
 \item \textbf{C}omplaint: The code itself should be correct and meet the system requirements.
 \item \textbf{E}conomical: The code should be responsible in terms of using system resources e.g. memory and CPU.
 
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
Legible - The code (the code itself, not comments) should clearly state the intent. If the reader can not make sense of the code, than all other efforts are doomed to frustration if not outright failure.

Testable - The code should be organized in a way that facilitates unit testing. That supports all subsequent efforts (refactoring for modification, correction of defects, revision due to changed specs, etc.)

Flexible - Dependencies, both on other code in the code base and arbitrary implementation choices, should be minimized. Hard-coded assumptions about data size, concrete classes or data structures, etc. make the code more brittle, and therefore harder to reuse or adapt.

Compliant - The code should comply with its requirements, functional and otherwise. (I don't state this as "correct" because the discussion about whether the requirements themselves were the "right" requirements is about the process or the environment, not about the code.)

Economical - The code should make reasonable use of system resources: memory, CPU, etc. (I don't state this as "efficient" because that word is too often misused, by limiting it to a single aspect, such as speed. Economy is simply about return on investment, and requires thought about all the resources being invested and all the measures of return.)

The point of insisting that these be considered in order is that each property supports the ones that follow. For example, defects (failure to comply with specs) in code which is legible, testable, and flexible can probably be corrected with reasonable effort. On the other hand, I suspect that every programmer has had experience with code which was micro-optimized for performance to the point that it was too brittle for reasonable maintenance.

\section{Schedule, Format and Quality}
After searching for suitable document templates, we believe the attached document from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, provides and excellent template. It is in MicroSoft Word format, so we will reformat into LaTeX, taking the opportunity to omit sections that are not relevant and ensure it fits our needs. This answers the question on format, and contains the necessary guidance on quality management as well. 

\footnote{se.inf.ethz.ch/old/.../Project Plan wo QA, Transition.doc}
\subsection{Initial Schedule of Work}

When we receive the project requirements on 18/2/15, the initial actions are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Arrange a team meeting as soon as possible to review the document
  \item Set up and populate an open issues register, add all open questions to the register (Simon)
  \item Initial decomposition into work domains, arranged by team strengths as far as possible
  \item Create a first draft WBS \footnote{Work Breakdown Structure, a simple way to magae deliverables in a project (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work\_breakdown\_structure)} structure and assign names and target dates to each work package.
  \item Customer Interface Manager (SH) to arrange meeting(s) with Ben Mora to resolve all open questions.
  \item Test Manager (MK) to create outline test plan, showing what elements will be tested by which techniques, and setting up any necessary infrastructure.
  \item Design Manager (DT) to create high level design
  \item Implementation Manager (IA) to create high level implementation plan, and take ownership and manage the WBS schedule.
\end{itemize}
All of these actions to be completed by Monday 2 March 2015.
\newpage
\section{Environment}

It is assumed that the project will be developed in Java.
\\
The team members use different desktop OS including Linux, OS X and Windows, so tools must support each of these. We have agreements or working assumptions or proposals for all identified software components:\par
